              I am suspended between worlds. Between our Arcadia, the Down Below
              and the Unknown. I am in Tartahk. I saw the name in my dreams and
              I put it to paper, without comprehending its meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hear my friends behind me. I hear the hyenas below me. I hear
              unknown voices in the distance. I see seven flags unfurled. Safe
              lands. The city of Euphemia awaits beyond the gate, but what it
              is, I do not know.
            </p>
            <p>
              I must not move downwards. I escaped the Down Below once and I
              will not return. And I cannot return to our paradise - the road
              back is never the same. So there is only one direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The world has shifted. Why has the world shifted? How did she find
              me? Am I the fire woman? The hanged man appeared in our visions
              and we paid no heed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Down Below, in another life, I heard whispers. I followed
              them. I did not understand it at the time. The voice, the phantom,
              a path through a gate. But now I do.
